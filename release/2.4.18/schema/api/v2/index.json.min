Builder","description":"\nBuilds an unsigned transaction that once signed and submitted will send funds, store arbitrary data on-chain, mint tokens and nfts, manage stake delegation and rewards, execute smart contracts, among all the amazing Cardano protocol features you can consume with it. \n\nYou can combine all these transactions capabilities on a single transaction as long as you don't hit the maximum transaction size value specified on protocol parameters.\n\nThis is a powerful and flexible transaction-building API. These are it's key features:\n - powered by Emurgo's Cardano Serialization Lib: is a practical wrapper of this library, but callable through JSON arguments\n - automatic/manual coin selection algorithms: a healthy UTXO set is one managed by wallets, not by dapps \n - automatic/manual change output optimizers algorithms: a healthy UTXO set is one early-planned by wallets, not late-fixed by dapps\n - smart minimum coin values per output: only focus in what you need to send, protocol complexities will be solved by the wallet automatically to ensure transaction validity\n - friendly missing-balance error handling: a smart UI screen will appear to let users refill their wallets in order to continue with script execution gracefully \n - transport-agnostic solution: the first and only dapp connector API able to build transactions properly on-the-fly, allowing even static QR codes to trigger them on any user wallet. Yes, even multisig and plutus transactions! We really care for RealFi.\n - intelligent Plutus/Native script support: our internal script manager maps every transaction feature with it's plutus/native validator script, up to the point that some function arguments can be inferred automatically making developers life easier with such complex tasks. \n - developer-friendly plutus API: Things like enforcing and handling static input/mint/cert/reward indexes for redeemers is a thing of the past.\n - flexible plutus and multisig signature handling: several options allow you or the wallet to plan worst case scenario for reserving bytes for maximum amount of transaction witnesses.\n - workspace support: our multisig / script based wallet setups are totally integrated on transaction builder API allowing the most flexible and adaptive multisig wallet experience on Cardano ever experienced.\n - smart on-chain transaction features: title, descriptions, tags, parent reference, action-urls, and more are exclusive GameChanger Wallet features since 2021\n - and more...\n\nFull documentation on how to build, sign and submit Transactions <a href=\"https://github.com/GameChangerFinance/gamechanger.wallet/blob/main/docs/transactions/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> here </a> .\n","properties":{"type":{"type":"string","const":"buildTx"},"title":{"description":"On-chain title of the transaction","anyOf":[{"type":"string"},{"$ref":"lang.json","type":"string","title":"Inline Scripting Language (ISL)","description":"Complementary programming language with functions to perform memory, string, arithmetic, cryptographic, encoding, logging, debugging, and other secondary operations"}]},"description":{"description":"On-chain description of the transaction","anyOf":[{"type":"string"},{"$ref":"lang.json","type":"string","title":"Inline Scripting Language (ISL)","description":"Complementary programming language with functions to perform memory, string, arithmetic, cryptographic, encoding, logging, debugging, and other secondary operations"}]},"id":{"description":"On-chain custom unique identifier of the transaction","anyOf":[{"type":"string"},{"$ref":"lang.json","type":"string","title":"Inline Scripting Language (ISL)","description":"Complementary programming language with functions to perform memory, string, arithmetic, cryptographic, encoding, logging, debugging, and other secondary operations"}]},"tags":{"title":"List of Tags","description":"List or Key-Value Map of Tags, on-chain custom list of strings or keywords to identify transactions by categories","anyOf":[{"$ref":"lang.json","type":"string","title":"Inline Scripting Language (ISL)","description":"Complementary programming language with functions to perform memory, string, arithmetic, cryptographic, encoding, logging, debugging, and other secondary operations"},{"title":"Array","type":"array","minItems":1,"items":{"anyOf":[{"type":"string"},{"$ref":"lang.json","type":"string","title":"Inline Scripting Language (ISL)","description":"Complementary programming language with functions to perform memory, string, arithmetic, cryptographic, encoding, logging, debugging, and other secondary operations"}]}},{"title":"Numerical key map","type":"object","propertyNames":{"pattern":"^[0-9]*$"},"minProperties":1,"patternProperties":{"":{"anyOf":[{"type":"string"},{"$ref":"lang.json","type":"string","title":"Inline Scripting Language (ISL)","description":"Complementary programming language with functions to perform memory, string, arithmetic, cryptographic, encoding, logging, debugging, and other secondary operations"}]}},"additionalProperties":false},{"title":"Alphanumerical key map","type":"object","propertyNames":{"pattern":"^[A-Za-z0-9_]*$"},"minProperties":1,"patternProperties":{"":{"anyOf":[{"type":"string"},{"$ref":"lang.json","type":"string","title":"Inline Scripting Language (ISL)","description":"Complementary programming language with functions to perform memory, string, arithmetic, cryptographic, encoding, logging, debugging, and other secondary operations"}]}},"additionalProperties":false}]},"indexOf":{"description":"On-chain custom index of the transaction within it's group","anyOf":[{"type":"number"},{"$ref":"lang.json","type":"string","title":"Inline Scripting Language (ISL)","description":"Complementary programming language with functions to perform memory, string, arithmetic, cryptographic, encoding, logging, debugging, and other secondary operations"}]},"group":{"description":"On-chain custom group name where this transaction belongs","anyOf":[{"type":"string"},{"$ref":"lang.json","type":"string","title":"Inline Scripting Language (ISL)","description":"Complementary programming language with functions to perform memory, string, arithmetic, cryptographic, encoding, logging, debugging, and other secondary operations"}]},"parentTxHash":{"description":"On-chain custom transaction hash of a transaction considered parent of this one, or that this one is a reply to it","anyOf":[{"type":"string"},{"$ref":"lang.json","type":"string","title":"Inline Scripting Language (ISL)","description":"Complementary programming language with functions to perform memory, string, arithmetic, cryptographic, encoding, logging, debugging, and other secondary operations"}]},"onSuccessURL":{"description":"[Deprecated].

Yes, even multisig and plutus transactions! We really care for RealFi.\n - intelligent Plutus/Native script support: our internal script manager maps every transaction feature with it's plutus/native validator script, up to the point that some function arguments can be inferred automatically making developers life easier with such complex tasks. \n - developer-friendly plutus API: Things like enforcing and handling static input/mint/cert/reward indexes for redeemers is a thing of the past.\n - flexible plutus and multisig signature handling: several options allow you or the wallet to plan worst case scenario for reserving bytes for maximum amount of transaction witnesses.\n - workspace support: our multisig / script based wallet setups are totally integrated on transaction builder API allowing the most flexible and adaptive multisig wallet experience on Cardano ever experienced.\n - smart on-chain transaction features: title, descriptions, tags, parent reference, action-urls, and more are exclusive GameChanger Wallet features since 2021\n - and more...\n\nFull documentation on how to build, sign and submit Transactions <a href=\"https://github.com/GameChangerFinance/gamechanger.wallet/blob/main/docs/transactions/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> here </a> .\n"},{"$ref":"signTx.json","type":"object","title":"Transaction Signing","description":"[Deprecated].

We really care for RealFi.\n - intelligent Plutus/Native script support: our internal script manager maps every transaction feature with it's plutus/native validator script, up to the point that some function arguments can be inferred automatically making developers life easier with such complex tasks. \n - developer-friendly plutus API: Things like enforcing and handling static input/mint/cert/reward indexes for redeemers is a thing of the past.\n - flexible plutus and multisig signature handling: several options allow you or the wallet to plan worst case scenario for reserving bytes for maximum amount of transaction witnesses.\n - workspace support: our multisig / script based wallet setups are totally integrated on transaction builder API allowing the most flexible and adaptive multisig wallet experience on Cardano ever experienced.\n - smart on-chain transaction features: title, descriptions, tags, parent reference, action-urls, and more are exclusive GameChanger Wallet features since 2021\n - and more...\n\nFull documentation on how to build, sign and submit Transactions <a href=\"https://github.com/GameChangerFinance/gamechanger.wallet/blob/main/docs/transactions/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> here </a> .\n"},{"$ref":"signTx.json","type":"object","title":"Transaction Signing","description":"[Deprecated].
