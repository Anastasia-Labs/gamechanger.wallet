## The Cardano Meta Wallet

GameChanger is a very powerful, customizable, yet friendly, non custodial web light wallet. 

Since 2021 unleashes Cardano's and eUTXO potential while democratizing users, developers and students access.

The smart design principles of the wallet allows you to import or connect these wallet types to it:
 - seed phrase
 - QR encrypted (personal and gift wallets) 
 - Ledger and Trezor hardware wallets 
 - Nami, Eternl, Flint, any browser extension wallets
 - Shared Treasuries
 
 And dapps, devices, users and other agents can use links and QR codes to seamlessly communicate with the wallet.

 **One wallet to have them all, on Desktop and Mobile, with the same dapp connector.**
