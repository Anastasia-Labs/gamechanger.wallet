# [Transactions](README.md) / Multi-signatures

## Introduction

**GameChanger Wallet** allows you to handle transactions that requires multiple key signatures from different users, services or dapp wallets for all **spend**,**mint**,**reward** and **cert** features.

[Unimatrix Sync](https://github.com/GameChangerFinance/unimatrix), **Roundtable** and **manual** transaction key witness sharing **[signTxs](https://beta-wallet.gamechanger.finance/doc/api/v2/signTxs.html) plugins** allow users to sign transactions almost without noticing a multi-signature scenario is involved. 

In addition to building transactions with manually-defined multi-signature features, you can leverage on [Workspaces](../workspaces/overview.md) to help you create seamless transactions between personal wallet and multisig wallet users (script-based addresses).

Go to [Multisig Workspaces and Seamless Transactions](../workspaces/multisigs.md) to learn more about it.
