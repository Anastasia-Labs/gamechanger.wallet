[![Dandelion-lite: Decentralized nodes for dummies for GC, Gimbalabs, Roundtable and devs](img/fund12/dandelion-lite.jpg)](
https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/120108)

**Problem:** To deliver professional applications Cardano requires a dApp to run back-end services. We intend to make these services easy to deploy and add several tools to make the back-end more powerful.

**Solution:** A distributed companion to Dandelion backend services. Allowing people with basic server management skills to instantiate a Dandelion-lite node. Add a new API using direct SQL

https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/120115)

**Problem:** GameChanger Wallet universal dApp connector does not have a specialized, third party, Integrated development environment. Developing dApps are already fast with Gamechanger but could be even faster

**Solution:** Create an online code editor using the VS code JS libraries. A first prototype can be found [here](https://inception.m2tec.nl/) (Inception). This tool can make launching dApps as simple as editing a JSON file and clicking deploy

## [Gamechanger: Education on Andamio and Work Courses](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/120445)

[![Gamechanger: Education on Andamio and Work Courses](img/fund12/andamio.jpg)](
https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/120445)

**Problem:** Currently Gamechanger has a large amount of examples and a language reference. There is minimal in-depth educational content.

**Solution:** Create a project-based learning experience that helps people develop dApp's efficiently with minimal setup and publish on Andamio and Work.Courses
