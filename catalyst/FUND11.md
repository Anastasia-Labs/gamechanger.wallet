## [GameChanger: open-sourcing now to help CIP30 spec upgrade](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/112468)

[![GameChanger: open-sourcing now to help CIP30 spec upgrade](img/dapp-conn.gif)](
https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/112468)

**Problem:** CIP-30 is about to be replaced or augmented to work like the first dapp connector GameChanger Wallet had back in 2021, without using this wallet’s 2.5 years journey into consideration

**Solution:** Due to the large work done, we offer open sourcing the full 2024 v2 dapp connector schema to serve as a reference or CIP itself after a final process of user feedback, maintenance and documentation

## [GameChanger: open-sourcing Unimatrix to democratize multisig](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/112470/)

[![GameChanger: open-sourcing Unimatrix to democratize multisig](img/unimatrix.gif)](
https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/112470)

**Problem:** Multisig Wallets, Single User Wallets, Dapps and Backends talk in different dapp connectors and centalized channels which makes Cardano impractical for true decentralized multisig interoperability.

**Solution:** We will open source our fully working, decentralized, privacy preserving Unimatrix Sync protocol for all kind of Cardano Wallets and Dapps to put an end to multisig interoperability issues.

## [Andamio - Gamechanger Helios dAPP and application backend course](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/112215/)

[![Andamio - Gamechanger Helios dAPP and application backend course](img/gc-pbl.gif)](
https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/112215)

**Problem:** Gamechanger protocol and application backend is immensely powerful. And allows for extremely quick dApp creation. A full course explaining this greatness has to be developed.

**Solution:** Create a 5 step course on the Andamio platform. Using the problem based learning approach.

## [Cardano Totem V2: Onboarding the world](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/112071/)

[![Cardano Totem V2: Onboarding the world](img/totem.gif)](
https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/112071)

**Problem:** From our experience building the first version of the totem we have received feedback to create a more conventional money conversion machine. Like the following device:

https://www.bleskomat.com/

**Solution:** Using the Totem housing we already created. But integrate Innovativ NV-9 bill acceptor and a Hyperpixel 4 and PI Zero 2. 

The housing will be available for any wallet builder in the Cardano ecosystem.

## [Dandelion PostgREST GUI for developers and students](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/112473/)

[![Dandelion PostgREST GUI for developers and students](img/postgrest-gui.gif)](
https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/112473)

**Problem:** Developers using Dandelion Community APIs do not have a UI tool to query the PostgREST API. Same as Koios, Blockfrost, and deployments relying on PostgresDB filled by cardano-db-sync or ledger-sync

**Solution:** We will provide an open source UI tool solution for developers for testing and querying Dandelion’s PostgREST API graphically
